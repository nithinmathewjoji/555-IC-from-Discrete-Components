## Key Features
- **Discrete Design**: Built entirely from individual components to demonstrate the internal workings of the NE555 IC.
- **Versatile Functionality**: Supports all the standard modes of the 555 timer, including astable, monostable, and bistable configurations.
- **Customizable**: Components can be swapped or adjusted for educational purposes or unique use cases.
- **Transparent Operation**: Every function of the 555 timer is visible and can be tested at different points using test pins.

## Applications

## How It Works
The internal operation of CircuitZilla mimics the NE555 timer's functionality through the interaction of multiple sub-circuits:

### Voltage Divider
- **Purpose**: Establishes two reference voltages, typically at 1/3 and 2/3 of the supply voltage (Vcc).
- **Components**: Resistors R1, R2, and R3 create this divider.
- **Function**: Provides reference levels for the comparators to evaluate the input signals.

### Comparators
- **Purpose**: Monitor the voltages on the Trigger and Threshold pins.
- **Components**: Transistors Q1-Q8 form two comparators.
- **Operation**:
  - The Trigger pin activates the lower comparator when its voltage drops below 1/3 Vcc, setting the flip-flop.
  - The Threshold pin activates the upper comparator when its voltage exceeds 2/3 Vcc, resetting the flip-flop.

### Flip-Flop
- **Purpose**: Stores the output state based on the comparator inputs.
- **Components**: Transistors Q9-Q12.
- **Operation**:
  - A Set signal from the lower comparator flips the output to high.
  - A Reset signal from the upper comparator flips the output to low.

### Output Stage
- **Purpose**: Amplifies the flip-flop's output and drives the connected load.
- **Components**: Transistors Q13-Q25 form the output stage.
- **Operation**:
  - Produces a high or low output signal depending on the flip-flop's state.
  - Designed to drive both small and medium loads efficiently.

### Discharge Mechanism
- **Purpose**: Controls the discharge of the timing capacitor to reset the cycle.
- **Components**: Transistor Q24.
- **Operation**:
  - When the flip-flop's state changes, Q24 connects the Discharge pin to ground, emptying the capacitor.

## Assembly Instructions
1. Gather all components as per the schematic.
2. Assemble the circuit on a breadboard or PCB following the provided schematic.
3. Ensure all connections are correct and soldered securely if using a PCB.
4. Test the circuit with an oscilloscope or multimeter at key test points.

## Usage
- Connect the power supply (typically 5V or 12V depending on transistor ratings).
- Set up external components (e.g., resistors, capacitors) for your desired configuration (astable, monostable, or bistable).
- Use test points to monitor internal circuit operations.

---

## Example Configurations
### Astable Mode
- **Timing Components**: Connect external resistors and capacitors between pins 6 (Threshold), 7 (Discharge), and 2 (Trigger).
- **Output**: Generates a continuous square wave.

### Monostable Mode
- **Trigger Input**: Provide a pulse to pin 2 (Trigger).
- **Output**: Generates a single pulse whose width is determined by external components.

## Troubleshooting
- **No Output**: Check the power supply connections and ensure all components are functional.
- **Incorrect Timing**: Verify external resistor and capacitor values.
- **Instability**: Add bypass capacitors near the power supply pins.
